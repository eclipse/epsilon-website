# Modelink

ModeLink is an editor consisting of 2-3 side-by-side EMF tree-based editors, and in combination with the reflective Exeed editor, it is very convenient for establishing links between different models using drag-and-drop. ModeLink uses native EMF cross-resource references to capture links between different models and as such, models constructed with it can be then used by any EMF-compliant tool/language.
