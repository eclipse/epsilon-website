# Human Usable Textual Notation

HUTN is an OMG standard for storing models in a human understandable
format. In a sense it is a human-oriented alternative to XMI; it has a
C-like style which uses curly braces instead of the verbose XML start
and end-element tags. Epsilon provides an implementation of HUTN which
has been realized using ETL for model-to-model transformation, EGL for
generating model-to-text transformations, and EVL for checking the
consistency of HUTN models.

## Features

-   Write models using a text editor
-   Generic-syntax: no need to specify parser
-   Error markers highlighting inconsistencies
-   Resilient to metamodel changes
-   Built-in HUTN-\>XMI and XMI-\>HUTN transformations
-   Automated builder (HUTN-\>XMI)
