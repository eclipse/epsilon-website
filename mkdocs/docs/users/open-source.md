- [MTC Flow](https://github.com/cadorca/mtcflow): MTC Flow s a tool which allows model-driven developers to design, develop, test and deploy Model Transformation Chains (MTCs). The tool offers a graphical DSL for defining MTC workflows independently of implementation technologies.
- [Melanee](http://melanee.org/): Melanee is a workbench for creating domain-specific languages which occupy an arbitrary number of ontological levels. It ships with a default general-purpose notation which is designed with the UML and Entity-Relationship diagrams in mind.
- [JastEMF](https://bitbucket.org/jastemf/jastemf-plugins/wiki/Approach.md): JastEMF is a tool to support the integrated use of the JastAdd system - a rewriteable, circular, reference attribute grammar (ReCRAG) generator - and the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) - a Java based metamodeling framework built around the Ecore metamodeling language.

The HiLeS2 Framework purpose is to serve as a platform to create Embedded System Product Lines. It incorporates both tools developed by the group and open source tools to provide an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) suitable for system specification, product line construction and virtual prototype generation.
- [EERCASE](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/eercase/): The Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model is one of the most used modeling languages for the conceptual design of database. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no metamodels and Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool that provide support to code generation and schema validation from conceptual data model according to the EER classical notation (i.e., Chen/Elmasri and Navathe's notation -  cf. Fig below). Aiming to overcome the previous shortcoming, we have proposed a metamodel and a CASE tool named EER MetaModel (EERMM) and EERCASE, respectively.
- [metaDepth](https://metadepth.org/): metaDepth is a framework for deep meta-modelling that provide supports for an arbitrary number of ontological meta-levels. This makes MetaDepth especially useful to define multi-level languages.

- [Pongo MongoDB Generator](https://code.google.com/p/pongo/): Pongo is a template-based Java POJO generator for MongoDB. Instead of using low-level DBObjects to interact with your MongoDB database, with Pongo you can define your data/domain model using Emfatic and then generate strongly-typed Java classes you can then use to work with your database at a more convenient level of abstraction.
- [TENTE C#](https://code.google.com/p/tentecsharp/): TENTE is a contribution for SPL architectural design and implementation. This process integrates relevant advances, from an SPL point of view, for separation of concerns and MDD technologies. This project contains the TENTE code generators for the C# approach.

- [MIDE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mide-bgu/): MIDE is an IDE for working with UML Class Diagrams. It extends the Eclipse UML2 Editor and enables carrying out complex tasks in one click, and provides a pattern-matching engine for detecting design errors as soon as they are made
- [Event-B](http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Transformation_patterns): Event-B is a formal method for system-level modelling and analysis. Key features of Event-B are the use of set theory as a modelling notation, the use of refinement to represent systems at different abstraction levels and the use of mathematical proof to verify consistency between refinement levels.
- [PhpNoDB](https://code.google.com/p/phpnodb/): While having a database is essential for any large-scale website, it can be an overkill for smaller projects/prototypes where read-only access to a small dataset would be sufficient. To save you the trouble of setting up and managing a database if you don't really need one, phpnodb lets you capture your data in a Google Spreadsheet and then generate from it a standalone PHP class that contains an embedded copy of your data.
- [Collaborative Modeling Framework](https://github.com/philipdesmedt/Thesis-Android): This modeling framework uses the MetaDepth framework to model and generate collaborative Android applications. The framework includes - among others - chat, Dropbox, Foursquare and geo components.

MMINT allows modelers to do rapid prototyping and exploratory modeling while seamlessly keeping track of all relevant artifacts in their workspace. MMINT is developed by the Software Engineering group at the University of Toronto, under the supervision of Professor Marsha Chechik.
- [MDebugger](https://github.com/moji1/MDebugger): MDebugger is a platform-independent model-level debugger for UML-RT models. It provides live debugging features (e.g., breakpoints) to debug generated systems from UML-RT models without using any program debugger or referring to the generated source code. To make it platform-independent, it uses model transformation (i.e. the Epsilon Object Language) to add support for debugging capabilities to the models.
